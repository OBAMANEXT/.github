## OBAMA-NEXT

This is the GitHub organization for the OBAMA-NEXT project. This project is funded by the European Union under **HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-01: Observing and mapping biodiversity and ecosystems**, with particular focus on coastal and marine ecosystems.

### Project Description

The methodology of OBAMA-NEXT builds on three main activities: ​

* Assess existing and new data sources for marine habitats​

* Involving stakeholders, convert the resultant data into relevant information products (maps and time series of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystem function) through the development of analysis toolboxes​

* Ensure the toolbox fulfils the needs of relevant stakeholders and policy goal​

OBAMA-NEXT will develop innovative tools to monitor and describe marine organisms, from microbes to mammals, and ecosystem services across different habitat types in European coastal and marine waters. 
This will require an overarching approach to identify relevant and needed information products, as well as their validation and applicability, to ensure spatial coherence across organism groups. 
This also requires a broad project team, including specialists of specific organisms and habitats, ecosystem dynamics, and functioning scientists capable of developing algorithms and models. 
Therefore, close collaboration between every partner will be essential to the successful completion of OBAMA-NEXT.​
